# Websocket Project
This is my python websocket project.
I decided to abandon this project because i have a node.js websocket backend and a python flask web backend, and setting up a wsgi server is harder than I thought, so I will recode this project using only javascript.
ExpressJS has an options for https traffic, so I can easily include an ssl certificate and key.
My nodejs websocket repo will be private untill I'm done.
